==================
Evaluating a model
==================

What are the issues about evlauating a model, in particular
with regard to complex models (e.g. convolution grids) and
filters?

.. note::
   
   Does it make sense to have this before or after the
   :doc:`binned/unbinned model <integrate>` discussion?
