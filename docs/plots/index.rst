Overview
========

Sherpa has support for different plot backends, at present limited
to matplotlib and Crates. Interactive visualizations of images is
provided by DS9 - an Astronomical image viewer - if installed.

.. note::

   The `sherpa.plot` module also includes error-estimation
   routines, such as the `IntervalProjection` class. This is mixing
   analysis with visualization, which may not be ideal.
